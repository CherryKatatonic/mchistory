This was the first web application I ever built. I was learning everything on my own as I was building it, so it's rough around the edges and contains a plethora of terrible coding/webdev practices. I just haven't had time to go back and fix it up yet.

Some of the technologies/features of the site include:
- Responsive UI for mobile browsing
- Google Datastore API for database operations
- Google Storage API for file storage/serving
- Google Domains for domain registration and DNS configuration
- Mailgun email API for user email verification, tech support requests, password recovery
- Vultr for server hosting
- Ability for users to create accounts, edit profile
- Ability for admin users to create/edit/delete content on the site
